```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## How can I deploy this project?

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

This repository now contains an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds the production bundle and publishes it to GitHub Pages. To enable it:

1. In your repository settings set **Pages â†’ Build and deployment** to use **GitHub Actions**.
2. Push to the `main` branch. The workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) will install dependencies, run `npm run build:pages`, upload the generated `docs/` folder as an artifact and deploy it.

You can also build the `docs/` folder locally when you need to inspect the production output:

```sh
npm run build:pages
npm run preview:pages
```

### Preparing a PWA package for RuStore

Run the dedicated PWA build to generate a bundle with a root base path that PWA Builder can ingest:

```sh
npm run build:pwa
```

The optimized assets are written to `dist/`. Upload the resulting `dist/manifest.webmanifest` (plus the icon files from `public/`) to [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) to create the RuStore package. You can locally verify the package with:

```sh
npm run preview:pwa
```
